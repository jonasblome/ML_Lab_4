    "# In the last exercise, we tried to find a polynomial function whose curve approximated\n",
    "# a series of data points as best as possible. The values of the function were randomly selected\n",
    "# and the best combination was stored. In theory, higher-order polynomials should describe the curve even better,\n",
    "# but at the same time, it is becoming more and more difficult to obtain good coefficients.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# One way to counteract this problem is to normalize the data.\n",
    "# If all data values are between 0.0 and 1.0 it is easier to find suitable coefficients.\n",
    "# In addition, the coefficients have been randomly selected so far,\n",
    "# and it is possible that bad combinations have been tried several times.\n",
    "# Ideally, only good combinations should be considered and improved step by step.\n",

    "# but rather use the first 6 columns to predict the 7th column.\n",
    "# The aim is to predict the fuel consumption of cars.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# The meaning of the columns in the cars matrix:\n",
    "# 1. \"cylinders\" = number of the cylinders\n",
    "# 2. \"displacement\" = space in the back of the car\n",
    "# 3. \"horsepower\" = power of the engine\n",
    "# 4. \"weight\" = weight in pounds\n",
    "# 5. \"acceleration\" = time to accelerate from 0 to 60 miles per hour\n",
    "# 6. \"model year\" = release date\n",
    "# 7. \"mpg\" = miles per gallon\n",
    "#\n",
    "# First normalize all data, use the first 6 columns as input data and try to predict the 7th column.\n",
    "# Evaluate your predictions with the RMSE. Since several input data/columns are now used,\n",
